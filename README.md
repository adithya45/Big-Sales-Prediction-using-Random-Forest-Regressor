##Big Sales Prediction using Random Forest Regressor
Overview
This project aims to predict sales for a large dataset using the Random Forest Regressor, a powerful ensemble learning method. The goal is to build a model that accurately forecasts sales based on historical data, leveraging the strength of random forests in handling large datasets with high dimensionality and complex relationships.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and trends to gain insights.
Model Building: Implementing a Random Forest Regressor using scikit-learn.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the model using techniques like Grid Search and Random Search.
Deployment: Preparing the model for deployment in a real-world environment.
