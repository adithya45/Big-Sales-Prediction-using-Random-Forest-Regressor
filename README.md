# Big-Sales-Prediction-using-Random-Forest-Regressor
This project aims to predict sales for a large dataset using the Random Forest Regressor, a powerful ensemble learning method. The goal is to build a model that accurately forecasts sales based on historical data, leveraging the strength of random forests in handling large datasets with high dimensionality and complex relationships.
